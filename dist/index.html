              <p>
                My name is Joanna. I am 27 years old and I am from Poland. I
                have master degree in Civil Engineering and currently work as an
                Architect. I am highly self-motivated, focused and innovative
                person with experience in engineering design. I have a passion
                for learning and developing new and existing skills. I love
                creating new things and I really enjoy solving problems.

              <h2>Why Tech?</h2>
              <p>
                I would like to start a career as a web developer because of the
                many advantages. Web development can gives me the opportunity to
                express myself creatively on the internet. I also love problem
                solving and that is something technology requires.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a huge demand for technology right now and you could
                choose a company that really suits your needs. If you are good
                enough you can have a good income.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next advantage is that you can work from anywhere. Of course not
                all jobs are remote, but I am pretty sure there are many
                companies that accept this. This is wonderful that you can have
                freedom to work wherever you want from.
